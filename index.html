                    <p>October 2020--
                        Data Science Immersive has proven to be a challenge in every sense of the word.  I came into this with some Python knowledge, and what I thought was a solid background in math.  How difficult can this be?  Just to give the reader an idea of the statistics background I have I will share my experience with this once phantom branch of math.  When I was in my undergrad, statistics was the most hated of all courses, lasted one quarter, and never thought of again.  The only other time I saw a statistics problem was on a test and it was to determine the probability of a string of nucleotides.  As students, we all cried and moaned until the teacher reduced the points it was worth on the test.</p>
                        <p>
                        The other experience I unknowingly had with a regression model was in chemistry.  We were titrating an acid until it became neutral and we were plotting the pH to the volume of base added.  We manually drew a line of the best fit curve.  Who needs MatPlotLib when you have a ruler and a pencil?  Apparently, much has changed since then.  Back then we had computer labs and now we have devices littering our house as well as an Apple Watch James Bond style. Not only that, many STEM graduates know a programming language that was once only reserved for computer science majors. </p> 
                        <p>
                        The fact that our collective knowledge of math and science has grown exponentially is both daunting and exciting.  I have enjoyed combining my new acquired programming skills, linear algebra, statistics, data visualizations, google slides, and public speaking into a thrilling experience.  One of the best skills that I have acquired is how to ask a question and find answers. Google is a great place to start, with most questions already asked on Stack Overflow or answered on websites such as GeeksForGeeks.  YouTube has been a wonderful source for reinforcing the statistics knowledge by way of the StatQuest channel.  It  is almost impossible not to have your knowledge expanded or filled in with these resources.</p>  
                        <p> 
                        I look forward to re-entering the genomics and bioinformatics space with my new skills.  There is so much to apply in this ever expanding field.  Neural networks are analyzing 3-D structure of proteins, statistical models of RNA expression show us pictures of cell metabolism, and protein cascades are being analyzed for statistically significant signals.  Data science and molecular biology have officially married.</p>

                    </p>September 2020--Taking time off from your career, for any reason, is a risky endeavor.  Depending on your personal convictions and situation, you may end up being absent from a normal nine-to-five job for years.  For many people, including myself, it is an isolating and vulnerable position.  We normally rely on someone or something else for income and we are removed from one of the basic social fabrics of society, which is the workplace.  I know for many people the workplace is a stressful, necessary evil. But for those of who have been removed from it, either by choice or by circumstances, it is an institution that is greatly missed. Furthermore, most people must return to the workforce at one point in their lives and the battle to do so, feels at sometimes, insurmountable.  I’ve described the process of returning to the workforce as coming out of a deep sleep, like the fictional character, Rumpelstiltskin.
                    Last year the year circumstances in my life required me to look for a job.  What should I do?  I have a biology degree, worked in genomics at its infancy, and left after about seven years.  I had also, moved from the San Francisco Bay Area, which is rife with both biotech companies and academic institutions, to Austin, Texas.  There are many great industries that exist here in Austin, but it is definitely not known as a thriving genomics hotbed.  The first thing I did was look at local Meetups.  The Meetup website is a great resource for people who are trying to connect with others that have similar personal and professional interests.  A few months after I began searching for professional meetups, a local individual began a Bioinformatics group.  I was so excited!  I was also incredibly nervous about meeting people, whom I did not know and have never met, other than through an email. 
                    We were scheduled to meet at a local coffee shop, and after I located my group within the crowded shop, I noticed how much younger they were than me.  This made me extremely uncomfortable.  However, everyone was very professional and we all discussed how we were going to proceed with the group.  We discussed using Coursera, which is a wonderful educational platform that offers certificates and degrees. Many certificates are charged at a monthly, small fee.  I asked if employers look at these certificates to gauge hiring and one of the members told me employers looks at a portfolio of projects.  This stuck in the back of my mind.
                    It was very intimidating to do, but I began working on downloading, opening, and working on the bioinformatics course we chose with the group.  I felt like they knew so much more about technology and I was careful to ask pointed questions so that I did not appear as clueless as I felt. Long story short, the bioinformatics group folded, I had a handful of fits and starts of learning Python through different sources and stopped and started the bioinformatics course a few times.  In February 2020, I decided to try to learn Python one last time.   I found a course on Coursera focusing only on Python.  Jackpot!  The professors teaching the course taught Python the way my brain understood.  It took 3 months to finish a 4-month-paced course and in May, on my high school graduation day, I finished the course!  In the middle of the course I found a local Python meetup.  As timing would have it, the meetup was online due to the pandemic, which otherwise would have been difficult given my home life.  I went to the first few meetings and listen to how people were using Python, specifically data science, which was very intriguing to me.  During one off the meetings, the head of the group mentioned a data science bootcamp as an excellent way to transition careers.  I spent the summer researching different bootcamps and their respective requirements, as well as applying to jobs with my current skills.  Most, if not all the bootcamps, guided students in creating a portfolio of projects to present to potential employers.  Bingo! I told myself if I were not hired by a certain date, I would sign up for the bootcamp. I was not hired, I enrolled for the bootcamp, completed the pre-work and I can happily report I am currently in the pressure cooker of a 12-week, intensive, data science immersive!
